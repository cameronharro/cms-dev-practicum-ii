# Intent

What are my goals?
+ Create CMS Theme to pass **HubSpot's CMS for Developers II: Best Practices** Practicum. More information may be found [here](https://academy.hubspot.com/courses/cms-for-developers-best-practices).
+ Explore the cutting edge of HubSpot CMS Development using Projects and React.
  + [Documentation](https://github.hubspot.com/cms-react/)
  + [Demonstration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHUEZxwP0ps)

## Benefits of the new Project/React framework

Since I could pass the Practicum with a traditional HubL-based theme, why use the new framework? 

It provides:
+ Version control with GitHub, which is much better for collaboration and the ability to roll back changes to a successful build.
+ A more streamlined local development process using Vite for building and Hot Module Reloading, eliminating the need to upload every change to Hubspot to see them reflected in a preview.
+ (Mostly) a superset of the existing functionality â€” I can use my existing CMS Dev I Practicum as a starting point, as recommended.
+ Much better code reusability, especially around module fields.
+ Less duplicate application logic, since React + Islands work both client-side and server-side, unlike the JS/HubL divide that exists in traditional themes

Also, it demonstrates my active engagement in the HubSpot Devloper Ecosystem.

## Timeline
